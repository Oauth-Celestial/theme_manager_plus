## Getting started
First, add theme_manager_plus as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file

```dart
theme_manager_plus: ^0.0.2
```


 Create Your own class which defines colors and styles which you have to inject e.g

```dart
class AppTheme {
  Color? backgroundColor;
  TextStyle? heading;
  TextStyle? subheading;

  AppTheme({this.backgroundColor, this.heading, this.subheading});
}
```

Wrap your material app with the ThemeMangerWrapper and assign your light and dark theme and set the current theme to initial theme you want

```dart
home:ThemeManagerPlus<AppTheme>(
          currentTheme: lightTheme,
          darkTheme: Darktheme,
          lightTheme: lightTheme,
          child: MyApp()),
    );
```

Access data from theme 

```dart
 ThemeManagerPlus.of<AppTheme>(context).currentTheme.backgroundColor,
```

**Note:** Replace your class name with the custom class name 


**Change current theme with theme manager plus**

```dart
ThemeManagerPlus.of<AppTheme>(context).changeCurrentTheme();
```

**Check current theme is dark theme**

```dart
ThemeManagerPlus.of<AppTheme>(context).isDarkMode
```
